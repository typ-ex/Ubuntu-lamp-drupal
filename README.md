# Ubuntu-lamp-drupal
LAMP server with ubuntu and drupal

Currently at a point where it won't work out because composer won't install the dependencies.  It hangs in the playbook

ssh'ing via vagrant and running sudo composer install will work, but isn't advised as per composer documentation.

Odd that become doesn't take care of that.
